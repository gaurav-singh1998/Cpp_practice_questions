We know how binary search can be applied to an array to find an element in an
array but capability of binary search isn't only limited upto array but to any 
search space which is "monotonic" in nature. For eg:- A sorted array has a 
search space ehich is "monotonic" in nature.

Rules for applying binary search for finding the square root of a function
[1] Since n vs root(n) has monotonic search space binary search can be applied.
[2] The search space will be [0, 48]
[3] So first divide a number into two halves[0, 24] and [24, 48].
[4] Now since 24^2 is greater than 48 we will turn our focus of finding the 
    answer to the left side of 24 on the number line.
[5] Now the search space has been reduced to [0, 23]
[6] After dividing the new number lines into two halves we get the midpoint as
    12 now 12^2 is also greater than 48 now also will reduce our search space
    by focusing on [0, 11].
[7] Now after dividing the search space into two halves we get 5 as the midpoint
    Now 5^2 is less than 48 as a result we will now reduce our search space to the
    right side of 5 i.e. from [6, 10]. 
[8] Now after finding the midpoint in the search space we get 7 as the midpoint as  
    7^2 is greater than 48 we will reduce our focus to left side of 7 and as result
    we will only get a single number 6 as the ouput of the algorithm.

Here the search space and the method on how to reduce the search space known as 
validating function is differnt from the classical binary search and should be taught 
before applying the algorithm in different situation. So the main point to focus
upon is to think about the search space and the validating function carefully.

Once we have got the answer from applying binary search for our solution than
we can look if 6.1^2 is greater than 48, 6.2^2 is greater than 48, 6.3^2 is greater 
than 48 and so on suppose we go uptill 6.7^2 and found it is greater than 48
than we can surely say that 6.6 is the answer. So the final complexity of the 
algorithm is O(log(n) + P) where P is the required precison.
